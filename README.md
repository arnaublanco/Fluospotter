# Fluospotter

Fluospotter is an advanced end-to-end pipeline designed for comprehensive segmentation of nuclei and accurate detection of puncta within these nuclei from three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence microscopy images. It offers:

* **Robust Nuclei Segmentation:** Fluospotter employs a Deep Learning model to perform precise segmentation of nuclei in 3D, ensuring accurate delineation of their spatial boundaries.
* **Puncta Detection:** Leveraging sophisticated techniques, Fluospotter effectively identifies puncta within segmented nuclei, even in scenarios where puncta may overlap. Its high sensitivity enables the detection of puncta with exceptional accuracy.

With its robust segmentation capabilities and precise puncta detection, Fluospotter offers researchers a powerful tool for in-depth analysis of cellular structures and dynamics in fluorescence microscopy data.
