# Fluospotter

Fluospotter is an end-to-end pipeline designed for comprehensive segmentation of nuclei and accurate detection of puncta in fluorescence microscopy images. In short, it offers:

* **Nuclei segmentation:** Fluospotter employs a Deep Learning model to perform precise segmentation of nuclei in 3D, ensuring accurate delineation of their spatial boundaries.
* **Puncta detection:** Leveraging sophisticated techniques, Fluospotter effectively identifies puncta, even in scenarios where puncta may overlap.

With its robust segmentation capabilities and precise puncta detection, Fluospotter offers researchers a powerful tool for in-depth analysis of cellular structures and dynamics in fluorescence microscopy data.
